# RFM Analysis: Unlocking Customer Insights with Data

RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a powerful tool in the world of data-driven marketing and customer relationship management. It allows businesses to segment their customers based on their transactional behavior, helping them understand and target different customer groups more effectively. Let's delve into the details of RFM analysis and how it can be applied using SQL queries.

## Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM) Analysis

* Recency refers to how recently a customer has made a purchase. 
* Frequency measures how often a customer makes a purchase.
* Monetary represents the amount of money a customer spends. 
* By combining these three dimensions, businesses can create segments that reflect different levels of customer engagement and value.
One common approach to RFM analysis is to assign a score to each dimension for every customer. For example, customers who made a purchase more recently might receive a higher recency score, while those who spend more money might receive a higher monetary score. These scores can then be used to group customers into segments.
